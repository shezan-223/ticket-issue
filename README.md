(1)JSX is a syntax that lets you write HTML inside JavaScript. 

(2)  state is data that belongs to a component and can change inside it.

props are data passed from a parent component to a child, read-only.





(3) useState lets you add state to a function component. It gives you a value and a function to update that value, and React re-renders when it changes


(4)Put the state in a common parent component and pass it down as props. Children can send updates back with functions.

(5)  You use camelCase event names like onClick and pass a function that runs when the event happens.
